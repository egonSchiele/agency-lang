## Attachments (images & files)

`llm()`'s first argument can also be an **array** that mixes text with image and
file attachments. Bare strings in the array are text; use the `image()` and
`file()` builders from `std::thread` for attachments:

```ts
import { image, file } from "std::thread"

node main() {
  const answer = llm([
    "What's in this image, and how does it relate to the report?",
    image("./diagram.png"),               // local path
    image("https://example.com/a.jpg"),   // remote URL (auto-detected)
    file("./report.pdf"),                 // local PDF / file
  ])
  print(answer)
}
```

`image(source)` and `file(source)` accept a local path, an `http(s)` URL, or a
`data:` URI, and figure out which it is. Smoltalk reads the file, fetches the
URL, infers the MIME type, and enforces size limits when the call is sent — you
don't do any file I/O yourself.

Both builders take optional arguments:

- `mimeType` — set an explicit MIME type (overrides inference).
- `base64: true` — treat `source` as raw base64 data. A `mimeType` is then
  required, e.g. `image(data, mimeType: "image/png", base64: true)`. This is
  handy when you already hold base64 in memory — for example the base64 string
  inside the `Result` that `readBinary()` returns.
- `file(source, filename)` — the filename shown to the model; it defaults to the
  source's basename.

The same array form works with `userMessage()` from `std::thread`, so you can
seed a multimodal user turn into the conversation history:

```ts
import { userMessage, image } from "std::thread"

userMessage(["Here's the screenshot I mentioned", image("./screenshot.png")])
```

### Limitation: structured output inside block bodies

Any `return llm(...)` inside a block body — anywhere in the block,
not just at the end — falls back to a `string` structured-output
schema. This applies to `fork(...) as item { ... }` branches,
`guard(cost: $X) as { ... }` bodies, and any user-defined function
that takes a block parameter. Agency currently has no way to know
the block's declared return type at codegen time, so the LLM is
asked for a plain string. The block still runs and returns the
LLM's text reply, but you cannot get a typed object out of it.

```ts
type Response = { capital: string }

// ❌ The annotation on `result` is NOT propagated into the block.
// Each branch returns a plain string from the LLM.
const result: Response[] = fork(["France", "Spain"]) as country {
  return llm(`What is the capital of ${country}?`)
}
```

The workaround is to assign the LLM call to a typed local first, then
return it:

```ts
// ✅ The annotation on `reply` controls the LLM's structured output.
const result: Response[] = fork(["France", "Spain"]) as country {
  const reply: Response = llm(`What is the capital of ${country}?`)
  return reply
}
```

Any function defined in Agency can automatically be used as a tool for the LLM. Pass the function in the `tools` option:

```ts
def add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}

const result = llm("What is 4 + 5?", { tools: [add] })
print(result)
```

## Streaming

To stream your response back, you will need two things:
1. You will need to set the stream option on the LLM call to true.

```ts
const response = llm("What is the capital of France?", { stream: true })
```

2. You will need to provide an `onStream` callback function to handle the streamed data. Streaming only works when you use your agent through TypeScript or JavaScript, though hopefully this limitation will be resolved soon. When you call a node through TypeScript, provide the callbacks: 

```ts
const callbacks = {
  onStream: console.log
}

const result = await main("some-param", { callbacks })
```

## Initializer dependencies through function calls

When you write a top-level `static const` or `const`/`let` whose initializer references another top-level value from a different module, the compiler builds a dependency graph and arranges for the imported module's initialization to complete before yours runs. For direct references this is obvious:

```
// bar.agency
export static const barStatic = "hello"

// foo.agency
import { barStatic } from "./bar.agency"
static const fooStatic = barStatic + "!"  // bar's init runs first
```

The compiler also looks **one function deep** when discovering these dependencies. If your initializer calls a single function, the compiler walks that function's body once and treats any top-level value it reads as a dependency of your initializer:

```
// bar.agency
export static const barStatic = "hello"
export def getBar(): string { return barStatic }

// foo.agency
import { getBar } from "./bar.agency"
static const fooStatic = getBar() + "!"  // bar.barStatic counts as a dep
```

This catches the common case where you have a small wrapper function reading a value. The boundary stops at exactly one function-body hop. The following are **not** detected by static analysis:

- **Depth-2+ chains.** `getBar` calls `_helper` which reads `barStatic` — the compiler sees `getBar`'s body but does not follow `_helper`.
- **Function values stored in variables.** `const f = pickHelper(); const foo = f()` — the compiler cannot tell which function `f` ends up pointing at.
- **Method calls on user objects.** `obj.method()` — the compiler does not introspect class methods.
- **Built-in / stdlib functions.** Their bodies aren't Agency code, so the compiler treats them as opaque. Assume they don't read your top-level state.

Conditional reads inside a called function are treated as always-reads. That's a safe over-approximation: in the worst case you get a small amount of extra `await` work during initialization that doesn't affect correctness.

If your code goes past these limits, the runtime **read-before-init trap** is the safety net. It fires with a clear error message naming the top-level value that was read too early and the module it came from. The recommended fix is to restructure so the read happens inside a `node` or `def` that runs after initialization, not at the top level of another initializer.

For background on how static and global init are scheduled, see [Agency's execution model](/guide/execution-model).

## Writing TS helpers that participate in the run

TypeScript helpers called from Agency code can do more than return plain values: they can read the active runtime context, push thread messages, install interrupt handlers, take checkpoints, issue LLM calls, and wrap their bodies in resumable scopes. The full surface is exposed through one namespace:

```ts
import { agency } from "agency-lang/runtime";

export function summarize(text: string): Promise<string> {
  return agency.llm("Summarize in one sentence: " + text);
}
```

Every method on `agency.*` reads its dependencies from an AsyncLocalStorage frame the runtime installs around each step. When you call a TS helper from Agency code, the frame is already in place — your helper sees the same context the surrounding Agency function saw. (Most methods throw with a clear error if called outside an Agency frame; the `*Maybe` variants return `undefined` instead.)

Common patterns:

```ts
// Read context
const cost = agency.ctx().stateStack.localCost;
const apiKey = agency.global<string>("API_KEY", "config");

// Push thread messages
agency.thread.system("You are a careful editor.");
agency.thread.user("Please proofread the following.");

// Install a scoped handler
await agency.withHandler(
  (intr) => intr.effect === "std::read" ? approve("auto-y") : undefined,
  () => doWork(),
);

// Take a checkpoint
const cpId = await agency.checkpoint();

// Issue an LLM call with structured output
const { name, age } = await agency.llm("Extract", { schema: PersonSchema });
```

### Resumability boundary

```

Agency function bodies are resumable automatically: an interrupt in the middle of one re-enters at the same statement on resume. A plain TS helper called from Agency code is **not** resumable — on resume after an interrupt, the entire helper re-runs from the top. To get per-step resumability inside a TS helper, wrap the body in `agency.withResumableScope`:

```ts
return agency.withResumableScope({ name: "processOrder" }, async (s) => {
  const order     = await s.step(() => loadOrder(orderId));
  const validated = await s.step(() => validate(order));
  const stored    = await s.step(() => persist(validated));
  return stored;
});
```

Each `s.step(...)` is journaled against a serialized frame; on resume completed steps are skipped, the in-flight step re-runs from scratch. **Read the [determinism contract](/guide/ts-helpers#determinism-contract) before using this** — step bodies must be pure, and step ordering must be stable across resumes.

For the full reference of every `agency.*` method, the `LlmOpts` shape, the `ResumableScope` API, testing patterns, and anti-patterns, see [TypeScript helpers — the `agency.*` namespace](/guide/ts-helpers).

## Cancelling an in-progress agent

When you run an Agency agent from TypeScript, you can cancel it mid-execution. This tears down any in-flight LLM requests and throws an `AgencyCancelledError`. Here's how to abort an agent run.

The `onAgentStart` callback receives a `cancel` function you can call at any time:

```ts
import { main } from "./main.js";

let cancelAgent: (reason?: string) => void;

const result = await main({
  callbacks: {
    onAgentStart: ({ cancel }) => {
      cancelAgent = cancel;
    },
  },
});

// later, from a button handler, timeout, etc:
cancelAgent("user clicked stop");
```


### What happens when you cancel

When `cancel()` is called

1. Any in-flight LLM request is aborted immediately.
2. Any remaining tool calls in the current round are skipped.
3. Any remaining interrupt handlers are skipped.
4. An `AgencyCancelledError` is thrown, which propagates up to the caller.

Cancellation is permanent for that execution. Once cancelled, no further LLM calls can be made on that particular agent run. However, you can start a new agent run. You can read more about Agency's [execution model](/guide/execution-model).

To catch the abort in TypeScript, you can catch `AgencyCancelledError` (exported from `agency-lang/runtime`) or use the `isAbortError` helper:

```ts
import { AgencyCancelledError, isAbortError } from "agency-lang/runtime";

try {
  await main();
} catch (error) {
  if (isAbortError(error)) {
    // handle cancellation
  }
}
```

Now let's talk about Agency's execution model.
