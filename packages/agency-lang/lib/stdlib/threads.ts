/**
 * TS-side helpers for `stdlib/threads.agency` — the user-facing
 * cross-thread registry module. Wraps the `agency.threads.*` primitives
 * from Task 1 and owns a per-run cache of labels and summaries keyed
 * by thread id.
 *
 * Cache placement rationale: Agency-side `static const` maps are
 * immutable after initialization, so the registry cache has to live in
 * TS. Keeping it here also keeps the Agency module tiny and lets the
 * cache survive interrupt-resume cleanly (it is rebuilt the same way
 * the rest of the registry is — from the run's onThreadEnd events).
 *
 * Naming follows stdlib conventions: every export is `_`-prefixed and
 * reads its runtime context from AsyncLocalStorage via `agency.*`.

// (tests/agency-js/threads-fix-callback-propagation): a top-level
// Agency callback only fires when its OWNING module is imported
// AS THE ENTRY POINT of the run. Imported modules' top-level
// callbacks are compiled in but never wired to `ctx.topLevelCallbacks`
// because `__registerTopLevelCallbacks` is per-entry. A global
// JS-side hook here side-steps that limitation so the registry
// works transparently for any program that imports `std::threads`,
// with no boilerplate at the call site.
//
// Eager summarization (`thread(summarize: true)`) is intentionally
// NOT handled here: summarize() needs to make an LLM call, and
// firing an LLM call from a TS-side hook on every thread close
// would surprise users who only wanted to register the registry.
// Eager summarize remains an opt-in agency hook that users can add
// themselves; the v1 stdlib does lazy summarization at
// `listThreads()` call time instead (one call per thread that
// doesn't have a cached summary yet).
